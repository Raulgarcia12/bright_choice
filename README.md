## 🚀 Technical Highlights

### 🤖 Advanced ETL & Scraper Architecture
Our modular scraper service handles heterogeneous data sources with enterprise-grade robustness:
- **Multi-Engine Adapters:** Custom adapters using **Playwright** (dynamic JS rendering), **Cheerio** (high-speed static parsing), and **REST APIs**.
- **Data Integrity:** Implements **SHA-256 hashing** to detect granular specification changes and maintain a versioned, immutable change log.
- **Resiliency:** Built-in **Exponential Backoff** retry logic, proxy-ready request rotation, and domain-specific **Rate Limiting**.

### 📊 Business Intelligence & ROI Drivers
- **The Efficiency Frontier:** A real-time scatter plot analysis of $Price$ vs. $Luminous\ Efficacy\ (lm/W)$, identifying market leaders and over-priced outliers.
- **Convenience Score™:** A proprietary weighted algorithm that aggregates technical performance and warranty terms into a single, comparable metric.
- **Competitive Gap Analysis:** Automated benchmarking of manufacturer performance against market averages across different product categories (Bulb, Panel, High Bay).

### 🛠️ Cloud & Full-Stack Mastery
- **Serverless Analytics:** Business logic offloaded to **Supabase Edge Functions (Deno)** to ensure high-speed KPI computation on large datasets.
- **Granular Security:** Professional implementation of **Row Level Security (RLS)** at the database layer, combined with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in React.
- **Scalable UI:** Optimized for high data volume ($500+$ products) with client-side virtualization and smart pagination.

## ⚙️ Engineering Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18.x
- Supabase CLI / Project
- Playwright (for dynamic scrapers)

### 1. Project Initialization
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Raulgarcia12/bright_choice.git
cd bright_choice
npm install
```

### 2. Service-Level Environment
Configure the Scraper and Frontend with your Supabase keys:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=YOUR_ANON_KEY
```

### 3. Database Sync
Apply the professional schema (Tables, RLS, Views) via the Supabase SQL Editor:
`supabase/migrations/20260218010000_competitive_intelligence_schema.sql`

---

## 🔒 Security & Standards
- Standardized use of **TypeScript** for end-to-end type safety.
- **RLS (Row Level Security)** enforced on every table to ensure data tenancy and role isolation.
- Structured **Winston Logging** for audit trails and ETL debugging.
- **I18n** support for global scalability (EN/ES).
